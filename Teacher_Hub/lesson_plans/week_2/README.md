## Week 2 Lab

For this week's lab, we're going to be connecting to our raspberry pi using the following command:

### For Mac/linux
1.  Open Terminal
2.  When you see the dialog prompt appear, type in the following:
  * ```\#>ssh <username>@<hostname>```

e.g. ```#>ssh root@furiosa```

root = our username
furiosa = our hostname

### For Windows w/Putty
1. Open Putty
2. Type in <hostname> into the field at the top of the window
  * Should look like this:

In either case, you will see a fingerprint and be asked if you want to accept the fingerprint, type (or click) ```yes``` and press enter
Now that we have a shell on our remote machine, we can start playing with some linux commands!
