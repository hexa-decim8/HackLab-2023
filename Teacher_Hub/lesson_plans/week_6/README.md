##Outline
Began our discussions on exploitation and reverse engineering. What it is, and what we can get out of it.
Talked a little about 0-day findings and how the marketplace operates in response to 0-day exploits.

We also started talking about some of the legality around exploitation and what is needed in order to exploit something successfully.
