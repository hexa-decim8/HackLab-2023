# Scripts

These scripts are supportive to Hack Lab development

## distribute.sh
This shell script will allow teacher to distribute materials during class to all students during class.
NOTE: This utilizes the primary method of deployment (accessing the root account directly via SCP.) If students have changed their root passwords, this won't work properly!

## install.sh
This shell script should be run on new nodes and will automagically update, add and move everything around to where it needs to be for the class.
