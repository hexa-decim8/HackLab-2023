# Offensive Glossary:
* Attack surface - An attack surface is the sum of an organization’s attacker-exposed IT assets, whether these assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not and regardless of IT/security team awareness of them. The attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, and in subsidiary networks as well as those in third-party or partner environments.

* Attack path - An attack path is one or more security gaps that attackers can exploit to gain access to an IT asset and to move from one IT asset to another. A clear understanding of possible attack paths helps security teams accurately gauge cybersecurity risk.

* Banner Grabbing - Banner grabbing is a process of collecting intelligence about IT assets and the services available on those assets. Banners provide information such as the version of software running on a system. That intelligence can be used by IT and Security administrators, or by attackers, to get a sense of what vulnerabilities may be present on the asset. Banners provide limited value because the only security issues they might indicate are software version-related (e.g., CVEs) and even then banners won’t reflect that a system has been patched. Therefore, banner grabbing is prone to false-positives.

* 0-day/Zero Day - An vulnerability that is not yet known to the vendor who supports the hardware or software. If exploit code is available, this is a very powerful tool in the hands of a black hat.

* Bind shell - A Bind shell is a payload that will allow an attacker to connect directly to the host. The Bind payload requires the attacker to connect to the victim, rather than allowing the victim to connect out to the attacker. Bind shells are typically only useful when attempting to move laterally through a victim network.

* Black Hat - An unethical hacker.

* Breach - An unauthorized entry into a privileged system.

* Brute Force - An attack that involves trying every combination of username and password possible on a system until access is achieved.

* Callback - If all goes well, a successful exploit may result in a callback to your C2. The callback is the result of a reverse TCP payload rather than a Bind payload.

* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - A CVE is a standardized way of reporting and acknowledging the existence of a vulnerability. A CVE can be a good way of identifying potential ways of gaining initial access.

* Denial of Serice (DoS) - Not to be confused with the 'DOS' subsystem of Windows. A denial of service attack exhuasts the resources of a target system. This will sometimes result in the unavailability of a system or service.

* Enumeration - An early step in the recon stage of the red team methodology is enumeration. Enumerating a system involves collecting information about a target system which may be used un a future attack. Enumeration differs from recon as a general concept in that enumeration is typically information gathering on one specific target individual, system or network. 

* Expanding Access - Laterally moving through a network can also be referred to as "expanding access".

* Exploit - To take advantage of a vulnerability through either a fault in running code, or a misconfiguration.

* Initial Access - Initial access or "gaining a Foothold" is the first step into a victim's network. CVEs can be used to get initial access, but misconfigurations can also be used to gain this level of access.
