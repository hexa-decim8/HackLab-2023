# Offensive Glossary:
* Attack surface - An attack surface is the sum of an organization’s attacker-exposed IT assets, whether these assets are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not and regardless of IT/security team awareness of them. The attack surface changes continuously over time, and includes assets that are on-premises, in the cloud, and in subsidiary networks as well as those in third-party or partner environments.

* Attack path - An attack path is one or more security gaps that attackers can exploit to gain access to an IT asset and to move from one IT asset to another. A clear understanding of possible attack paths helps security teams accurately gauge cybersecurity risk.

* Banner Grabbing - Banner grabbing is a process of collecting intelligence about IT assets and the services available on those assets. Banners provide information such as the version of software running on a system. That intelligence can be used by IT and Security administrators, or by attackers, to get a sense of what vulnerabilities may be present on the asset. Banners provide limited value because the only security issues they might indicate are software version-related (e.g., CVEs) and even then banners won’t reflect that a system has been patched. Therefore, banner grabbing is prone to false-positives.
